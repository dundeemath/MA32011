## Introduction

Previously we described bifurcations in 1D systems. In this chapter we generalise these ideas to account for the more complex behaviour of 2D systems.

We will find that the previous notion of a bifurcation involving the creation/annihilation of fixed points or a change in their stability still holds. But we will must generalise to account for the presence of limit cycles in 2D systems.

::: {.Definiition}
If the phase portait changes its topological structure, a bifurcaiotn has occurred.

## Saddle node, transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations

The bifurcations introduced in Chapter X have analogues in two dimensions. The interesting dynamics occur in a 1D subspace whilst in the other dimension the flow is either simple attraction or repulsion.

Consider the system
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \mu - x^2 \\
\dot{y} &= -y.
\end{aligned}
$$

Sketch the phase portrait for different values of $\mu$.

Consider the system
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = -ax+y \\
\dot{y} &= \frac{x^2}{1+x^2}-by.
\end{aligned}
$$
where $a,b > 0$.

Show that there is a saddle node bifurcation at a critical value $a=a_c$.

::: {#exm-    }
Consider the system
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \mu x + y +\sin x \\
\dot{y} &= x-y.
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\mu \in \Re$. Show that a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation occurs at the origin and determine the bifurcation value $\mu_c$.

Simmilar examples can be considered for transcritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations. A common property of all the above bifurcations is that one of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian is zero. Next we will consider a new mechanism for bifurcations to arise. 


## Hopf bifurcations


Hopf bifurcations describe a bifurcation in which oscillatory solutions emerge. Supercritical Hopf bifurcations are characterised the  small amplitude oscillations close to the bifurcation point. In contrast, subcritical Hopf bifurcations large amplitude oscillations are typically found at the bifurcation. Hence a system can go from a stable steady state to large oscillation. The key idea with Hopf bifurcations is that there is a pair of complex eigenvalues that cross the imaginary axis. Hence at the bifurcation point the real part of the eigenvalues is zero but the imaginary part is not. Thus the Hopf bifurcation is qualitatively distinct from the previous bifurcations that we have considered (characterised by at least one eigenvalue being zero at the bifurcation point).



### Supercritical Hopf

The supercritical Hopf is known as 'soft' int he engineering literature: at the bifurcation point small amplitude oscillations emerge.

::: {#exm-    }
Consider the system
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{r} & = \mu r - r^3\\
\dot{\theta} &= \omega+br^2.
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\mu$, $\omega$ and $b$ are constants.

Show that the origin undergoes a supercritical Hopf bifurcation at $\mu=0$.
:::

Rules of thumb:

- The size of the limit cycle grows continuously from zero and increases proportional to $\sqrt{\mu-\mu_c}$ for $\mu$ close to $\mu_c$.
- the frequency of the limit cycle is given approximately by $\omega=\Im \lambda$ evaluated at $\mu=\mu_c$. The period is therefore approximately $2\pi/\Im(\lambda)$.

In more general cases the limit cycle is elliptical rather than circular and the imaginary part of the value also depends on $\mu$.
